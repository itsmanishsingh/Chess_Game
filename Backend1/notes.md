WebSocket:
A WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection between a client and a server. 
Unlike the traditional HTTP request-response model, WebSocket allows both the client and the server to send and receive data at any time, enabling real-time, interactive communication.
